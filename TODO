    We have promoted all the students except from X & XII in new session. In new session while taking fee receipts amount is not adjusting in proper manner for few scholars not for all(Exa. Scholar No. 2421, 2680, 2679, 2668, 2670, 2670, 2672, 2676, 2675, 2674 & full infant class )

    Above problem is not occurring with all scholars, for examples fee receipts taken of scholars like 2185, 3820, 2682, 2683, 2178 .... are OK.

    We are not able to Change section of scholar no. 2667 from Pre Nursery A to Pre Nursery A-RKP.

    Library issue is still pending.
